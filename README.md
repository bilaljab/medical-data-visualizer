# 📊 Medical Data Visualizer  

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.  
It uses pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize and analyze medical examination data.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Medical Data.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations  
- `medical_examination.csv` → Raw dataset used for analysis  
- `catplot.png` → Categorical plot of medical variables  
- `heatmap.png` → Heatmap showing correlation matrix

---

## 📌 Features

- Cleans and processes medical data (e.g., calculates BMI, normalizes values)
- Creates a categorical plot to compare medical features by activity and health conditions  
- Generates a heatmap of correlations between key medical variables  
- Uses Jupyter Notebook for clean and interactive analysis
